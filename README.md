# 🍹 Juice Nutrition Chatbot & Scanner

A lightweight, React-only application built during **Tech Avishkar 2.0 Hackathon**, where we secured **1st place** 🏆 and earned a **4-month internship opportunity**.

This app allows users to scan juice products like Frooti or Maaza, analyze their nutritional content using the Open Food Facts API, and receive healthier alternatives — all without using any backend or database.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ React frontend only (no backend, no database)
- ✅ Barcode scanner + chatbot UI
- ✅ Axios-powered API integration
- ✅ Real-time nutritional insights
- ✅ 15-min express proxy workaround during live evaluation 😅
